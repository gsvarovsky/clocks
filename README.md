# clocks
_ordered message delivery_

Foundational classes for establishing ordered delivery of messages to concurrent processes, with Vector Clock and Tree Clock implementations and process examples.

**[Feedback](https://github.com/gsvarovsky/clocks/issues) and contributions welcome!**

## usage
The main building block is a [MessageService](src/main/java/org/m_ld/clocks/MessageService.java), which is intended to be interposed between an application process (such as an Actor or Verticle) and the message transport (such as a realtime channel, websocket, or queue consumer).

The `MessageService` maintains an internal _clock_ state to determine the correct delivery order for incoming messages. It relies on the process to call its `send` and `receive` methods when sending or receiving a message from the transport; in doing so, the clock is suitably updated, and the message payload can be wrapped up or unwrapped and delivered, respectively.

An [example process](src/main/java/org/example/CausalCrdtProcess.java) is provided, as a generic Java class for the update of a CRDT requiring causal delivery, and further subclassed in a very naive fashion to implement an [OR-Set](src/main/java/org/example/OrSetProcess.java) (Observed-Removed-Set).

Two `MessageService` implementations are provided: a [Vector Clock service](src/main/java/org/m_ld/clocks/vector/VectorClockMessageService.java) and a [Tree Clock service](src/main/java/org/m_ld/clocks/tree/TreeClockMessageService.java), which is more efficient for dynamic systems.
